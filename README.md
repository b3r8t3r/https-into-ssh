## Readme
The script in repo could help you in moments like you do not have access for **github** for desktop and you are bored with searching for ssh link from mobile.

Just start the script and you'll get the ssh link for needed repo.

## Installation

To install script for your local environment, start file `setup.sh`. After that, you could use script with command `httpsconvert`.

## How it works

Start script with link on needed **https** **github** repo and script will return **ssh** link for it. Kinda useful if you do not have access for **github** for desktop.

## Properties
### For installed script

```bash
httpsconvert <repo> [<option>]
```

### For local use

```bash
./httpsconvert <repo> [<option>]
```

### Options

`-d` - Debug information. Shows the steps of work with link.

`-s` - Silent mode. In output shows only resulting ssh link.
